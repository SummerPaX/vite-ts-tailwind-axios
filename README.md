Vite + Typescript + Tailwind CSS + Axios Starter
====
Scaffold a new project with Vite, Typescript and Tailwind CSS preconfigured with ease.

## Motivation

Most existing Vite + Tailwind starters are aimed to work with a JS framework, e.g Vue or React.
This is a minimalistic Starter with only HTML/CSS/TS 

## When to use

1. When you need to develop a pure HTML/CSS/TS prototype.

**Happy coding!**
